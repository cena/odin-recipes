<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Gumbo! To the Louisiana native, like this author, there are few words that can summon more passion or ire.  Passion for a beloved native dish, and ire over disagreements about the best way to make it.</p>
<p> There's probably as many ways to make gumbo as there are people who eat it!  It' best to think of the following recipe as a sort of 'mother' recipe - a template with which you can extend and expand your own gumbo horizons.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>the Holy Trinity - bell pepper, onion, and celery<li>
<li>andouille sausage</li>
<li>chicken thighs</li>
<li>flour and oil for roux</li>
<li>seasonings</li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
<li>First, you make a roux</li>
<li>Generally, I make an oil-less roux these days.  I put a cup or two of flour in the oven at 350F, and bake it for about 3 hours.  Stir every 30-45 minutes.</li>
<li>Chop your trinity.  I usually do a 2:2:1 ratio of bell pepper:onion:celery.</li>
<li>Saute your trinity in butter, just enough to soften the veggies.</li>
<li>Add your dry roux, mixing in well.</li>
<li>Add chicken stock.</li>
<li>Add salt and pepper to taste, plus a bay leaf, cayenne to taste.</li>
<li>Add chicken meat and andouille.</li>
<li>Bring to a boil, then simmer.</li>
<li>Pour over rice.  Eat!</li>
